                                Nicole Bauthier is an avid fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the award-winning author of its most popular spin-off series, Frodo and Sam: Together at Last. Having memorized the trilogy and all supplemental texts, Nicole has defeated Stephen Colbert in a Silmarillion head-to-head no fewer than five times, and her love for the novels has been declared by J.R.R. Tolkien's heirs as "the embodiment of all things excessive." Like all things in her life, Nicole's strategic decisions for DangerZone Consulting are drawn from the world of Middle-Earth and the tenets of the noble creatures that reside there. For an additional fee, she will present your strategic recommendation in Elvish (in which she is fluent) wearing authentic Elvish garb.

                               Travis Bowers is one of the Senior Partners at DangerZone and leads up the home furnishings division.   After completing his schooling in Southern California, Mr. Bowers felt compelled to see the world and began a successful international career at ISIS.  During his travels, he found himself in a wide range of situations.  He has found these experiences to have toughened his skin and given him a strong ideological base for business.  Mr. Bowers decided to return to the states and work for DangerZone Consulting in early 2014.  Since joining the DangerZone team, Mr. Bowers has managed to steer an unprecedented 107% of his clients away from any perils the market may bring.  Given his storied background, Mr. Bowers is an expert in navigating danger zones and is a firm believer that all problems can be solved using an efficient blend of analysis and creativity; his keen eye for detail gives a unique ability to steer companies clear of any hazardous path they may be traveling.

                                A five time winner of the Olympic Gold Medal in Biathlon, Ben Brostoff believes that the two most important characteristics for success in business, and in life, are a steely resolve and an iron will. As a business strategy expert, Mr. Brostoff applies an active personal approach to meeting clients' business needs. For example, while working for notable finance pundit Stephen Colbert, Mr. Brostoff wrestled Vladimir Putin and a bear at the same time, submitting both in fewer than thirty seconds. He currently works at DangerZone Consulting, where he employs his "soft touch strategy" to help rescue companies venturing into zones of danger.

                                Andrew Helgren leads up DangerZone's health care division and also advises its home furnishings and energy divisions. Throughout his distinguished career, he has successfully guided many firms away from their looming perils and towards a brighter future. Andrew believes in maintaining a strong belief in oneself and one's business in the face of adversity and emphasizes that for all situations where danger arises, there is rescue line out there and one only needs to stay calm and reach for it. He has helped steer numerous companies away from the pit of bankruptcy and put them on a path towards steady profits and financial health. In particular, as a child, he helped to save his friend's lemonade stand that had fallen on tough times by recommending relocation to a more popular street corner and by reducing the size of glasses poured. Upon implementation, profits soared to over $10 a day as  business soon boomed and his friend began to franchise and dominate the neighborhood lemonade market.

                                Senior Vice President Harris Levin has been with DangerZone Consulting since its inception in early 2014. He is responsible for strategically advising Tesla Motors, Samsung, and Scientific Games Corporation. Prior to joining DangerZone Consulting, Harris was a frequent visitor of zones of danger throughout all seven continents, and he even discovered a very dangerous, unknown eighth continent. Years of danger have grown his beard long and bushy, while his hair remains perfectly intact. The juxtaposition of his rugged beard with his swanky hair assures clients that he is the best-suited man to lead their companies to safer, more profitable, metaphorical shores. In his free time he enjoys long walks on the beach, romantic comedies, and playing with kittens.

Of Singaporean descent, Jonathan was first exposed to zones of danger while serving in the Singaporean military for 2 years. Taking his military expertise internationally, he subsequently dabbled in and out of danger zones as a mercenary for hire, performing wet work for a variety of organizations in Southeast Asia.  Jonathan went underground for 9 months before joining Pomona College, moonlighting alternately as a barn dance choreographer and wedding worker. In his spare time, he enjoys cosmetic surgery and boxing midgets. Of his experiences in the zone, he remarked, "It's really when I'm in my danger zone that I truly feel alive, like I can harness all my energies towards accomplishing... anything".

                                After earning his MBA from the Harvard Business School and his PsyD in Clinical Psychology from the Yale School of Medicine, John Weiss decided to make the natural jump to business strategy consulting. Due in large part to his extensive education, Mr. Weiss is able to offer each client a unique business plan to address their individual needs, as well as a personalized regimen of prescription drugs to accelerate the decision-making process. Mr. Weiss is best known in the consulting world for his implementation of reverse psychology tactics, in which he identifies and advocates the worst possible advice to clients so that they actually choose the opposite, best course of action. He joined DangerZone Consulting in January 2014 and currently works as part of the company's medical consulting team.
